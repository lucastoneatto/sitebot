      <p>
        This page explains what cookies Sitebot uses and why. In short: we
        use a single technical cookie, strictly necessary for login to
        work. We do not use analytics, advertising, or cross-site tracking
        cookies.
      </p>

      <h2 id="que-son">1. What a cookie is</h2>
      <p>
        A cookie is a small file that a site stores in your browser to
        remember information between visits, such as keeping a session
        active.
      </p>

      <h2 id="que-usamos">2. What cookies we use</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Cookie</th>
            <th>Purpose</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Duration</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><code>sitebot_token</code></td>
            <td>Keep your session active on the Sitebot dashboard</td>
            <td>Strictly necessary, technical. <code>httpOnly</code> (not accessible by JavaScript) and <code>secure</code> in production (only travels over HTTPS).</td>
            <td>7 days, or until you sign out</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>
        This cookie is essential for the dashboard to function: without it
        you cannot stay signed in. Because it is a cookie strictly
        necessary for the Service you requested, it does not require prior
        consent under applicable regulations, although we still inform you
        of its existence on this page.
      </p>
      <p>We do not use analytics, audience measurement, advertising, or social media cookies on the Sitebot dashboard.</p>

      <h2 id="terceros">3. Third-party cookies</h2>
      <p>
        The Sitebot dashboard does not load third-party scripts that set
        cookies (no Google Analytics, no advertising pixels, no
        third-party support chats). If we add any in the future, we will
        update this page and, when necessary, request your consent before
        activating it.
      </p>

      <h2 id="widget">4. The chat widget embedded on other sites</h2>
      <p>
        The widget a Customer installs on their own website does not set
        tracking cookies on its visitors. It uses a conversation session
        identifier to be able to show the chat history during the visit;
        that identifier is not used to track the visitor across different
        sites or for advertising purposes.
      </p>

      <h2 id="gestionar">5. How to manage cookies</h2>
      <p>
        You can delete or block the <code>sitebot_token</code> cookie from
        your browser settings, though doing so will sign you out and
        you'll need to sign in again to use the dashboard.
      </p>

      <h2 id="cambios">6. Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        If we add new cookies that are not strictly necessary, we will
        update this page and request your consent when required by
        regulation.
      </p>

      <div className="legal-note">
        This policy reflects the cookies in use as of this update. If the
        project adds analytics, third-party billing, or other
        cookie-setting scripts, this document must be updated before they
        are deployed, and a non-essential cookie consent banner will
        likely be needed.
