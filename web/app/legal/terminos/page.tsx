      <p>
        These Terms of Service (the &quot;Terms&quot;) govern the use of
        Sitebot (the &quot;Service&quot;), a platform that crawls a website
        specified by the user and generates an embeddable chatbot from its
        content. By creating an account or using the Service you accept
        these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 id="quienes-somos">1. Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        Sitebot is operated by <strong>[FULL NAME], National ID/Tax ID
        [NUMBER]</strong>, with address at [ADDRESS], Argentina
        (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;the operator&quot;). You can contact us at{' '}
        <a href="mailto:hola@sitebot.dev">hola@sitebot.dev</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="objeto">2. What the Service is</h2>
      <p>
        You (the &quot;Customer&quot;) provide us the URL of a website that
        you own or that you are authorized to crawl. Sitebot:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Crawls that site (sitemap and internal links) and stores its content in text/Markdown format.</li>
        <li>Generates vector representations (&quot;embeddings&quot;) of that content so it can be searched by semantic similarity.</li>
        <li>Exposes an embeddable chat widget that, when a visitor to your site asks a question, looks up the most relevant content fragments and generates an answer from them, citing the source page.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Service is provided &quot;as is,&quot; in the phase and with the
        functionality described in the dashboard at any given time, which
        may be expanded or modified.
      </p>

      <h2 id="cuenta">3. Your account</h2>
      <p>
        To use the Service you need an account with an email and password.
        You are responsible for keeping your credentials confidential and
        for all activity that occurs under your account. Notify us
        immediately of any unauthorized use.
      </p>
      <p>You must provide accurate information when registering and keep it up to date.</p>

      <h2 id="uso-permitido">4. Permitted use of the crawler</h2>
      <p>By providing a URL to crawl, you represent and warrant that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are the owner of the site, or you have the express authorization of its owner to crawl it and index its content with Sitebot.</li>
        <li>The crawl does not violate the site's <code>robots.txt</code> (Sitebot respects it automatically) or the terms of use of the destination site.</li>
        <li>You will not use the Service to crawl third-party sites without authorization, nor to extract sensitive personal data, content protected by third-party intellectual property rights without permission, or illegal content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend the crawl or the account if we
        detect use that violates this section, without prejudice to other
        legal actions that may apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        Configurable technical limits also apply (maximum pages, depth,
        re-crawl frequency) to protect both your destination site and the
        Service's infrastructure.
      </p>

      <h2 id="contenido">5. Content and ownership</h2>
      <p>
        The content of your website remains yours (or that of whoever
        holds its original ownership). We only store and process it to
        provide you the Service: generating the chatbot and answering
        through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The conversations that your site's visitors have with the widget
        (questions, answers, and ratings) are associated with your account
        and you can view them from the dashboard. See the detail of how we
        handle this data in our{' '}
        <a href="/legal/privacidad">Privacy Policy</a> and in the{' '}
        <a href="/legal/procesamiento-datos">Data Processing Agreement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deleting a site from the dashboard cascades to delete all of its
        indexed content, conversation history, and associated
        configuration, irreversibly.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ia">6. Nature of the bot's responses</h2>
      <p>
        The chatbot's responses are generated by a language model
        (generative AI) based on your site's indexed content. Even though
        the system is designed to answer only with information present on
        your site and cite its source:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not guarantee that responses will always be accurate, complete, or free of model interpretation errors.</li>
        <li>The bot may indicate that it lacks sufficient information instead of answering, depending on its configuration.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for reviewing that the tone, content, and accuracy of the responses are appropriate for your site, and for adjusting the configuration (prompt, temperature) as needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Service must not be used as the sole source for medical,
        legal, financial, or safety decisions affecting your visitors.
      </p>

      <h2 id="terceros">7. Third-party providers</h2>
      <p>
        To generate chat responses, the relevant content from your site and
        the visitor's question are sent to an external language model
        provider (currently OpenAI) under its own terms and privacy
        policy. Embeddings (content indexing) are generated locally on our
        infrastructure, without being sent to third parties. More detail
        in the{' '}
        <a href="/legal/privacidad">Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="disponibilidad">8. Availability and changes</h2>
      <p>
        We will make reasonable efforts to keep the Service available, but
        we do not guarantee continuous or interruption-free availability.
        We may modify, limit, or discontinue functionality, with prior
        notice when the change is material.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms. Material changes will be notified by
        email or via a notice in the dashboard before they take effect.
        Continued use of the Service implies acceptance of the version in
        force.
      </p>

      <h2 id="suspension">9. Suspension and termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may deactivate your account at any time from the dashboard or
        by writing to us. We may suspend or cancel an account that
        violates these Terms, makes abusive use of the crawler, or
        creates risk for third parties or for the Service, notifying the
        reason when reasonably possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="responsabilidad">10. Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable
        for indirect damages, lost profits, or loss of data or business
        arising from use of the Service, including AI-generated responses.
        The Service is provided without implied warranties of fitness for
        a particular purpose.
      </p>

      <h2 id="ley">11. Governing law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the Argentine Republic.
        For any dispute, the parties submit to the ordinary competent
        courts of [CITY/JURISDICTION], waiving any other venue that might
        otherwise apply.
